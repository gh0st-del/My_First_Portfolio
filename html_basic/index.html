<p>Front-end development is the art of crafting the user-facing part of
     a website or web application. This encompasses everything a user
      interacts with directly,
       from the layout and design to the responsiveness and overall user experience.
        Front-end developers utilize a combination of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring these elements to life. HTML structures the content, CSS styles its presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.</p>
